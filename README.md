# Tree Galaxy

This program is a 3d gravitational N-body simulation based on the Barnes-Hut algorithm. A visualization of the interacting stars is provided using OpenGL. The initial conditions define a collision between the Milky Way and Andromeda (see Dubinski et al. 1996). A version of the program written entirely in C++ is also availible in the CPPfinal branch, here there is also an option for Plummer model initial conditions.

Youtube video of the collision:
